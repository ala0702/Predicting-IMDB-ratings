# Predicting-IMDB-ratings

## 1.1 Description
The aim of the project is to create a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on general information about it. Data about the movies, such as title, year of production, genre, director, cast, description, duration, etc., will be used as features to predict the IMDB rating.

## 1.2 Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook Environment
- Additional Programming Libraries: libraries include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn. Additionally, category_encoders library.
  - category_encoders: A Python library that provides tools for encoding categorical variables. It is used in data analysis and machine learning to transform categorical variables into numerical form that can be used by machine learning models.
    - Examples of category_encoders usage:
      - OrdinalEncoder:
        - Transforms categorical variables into ordinal numbers.
        - Assigns a unique integer to each category.
      - OneHotEncoder:
        - Creates "one-hot" encoding for categorical variables.
        - Creates new columns for each category.
        - Assigns a value of 1 when the category occurs, and 0 otherwise.
      - TargetEncoder:
        - Encodes categorical variables based on target values.
        - Assigns the average target value for each category.
      - BinaryEncoder:
        - Creates binary encoding for categorical variables.
        - Converts categories into binary representation.
      - HashingEncoder:
        - Transforms categorical variables into numerical values using a hashing function.

## 1.3 Database
We have chosen a dataset from Kaggle titled "IMDB Movies Dataset". This dataset contains information about the top 1000 movies and TV shows according to IMDb (Internet Movie Database).
Here is the description of each column:
- PosterLink: A column containing a link to the movie poster used on IMDb.
- SeriesTitle: The title or name of the film.
- ReleasedYear: Indicates the year in which the film was released.
- Certificate: This column shows the certificate or rating awarded to the film, indicating its suitability for specific age groups or viewers.
- Runtime: The total duration of the movie in minutes.
- Genre: This attribute describes the genre or category of the movie, indicating its theme or style.
- IMDBRating: Represents the rating of the movie as assigned by IMDb users on the IMDb website. Ratings are usually given on a scale of 1 to 10.
- Overview: This column contains a brief summary or description of the movie, presenting the general outline of the plot or theme.
- Metascore: The score obtained by the film, commonly referred to as "Metascore", which is the average rating of critics. Metascore is usually based on a scale of 0 to 100.
- Director: The first and last name of the film's director.
- Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4: These columns contain the names of stars or main actors/actresses associated with the film.
- Noofvotes: The total number of votes or ratings the movie received on IMDb.
- Gross: This attribute represents the financial earnings or box office revenue generated by the film.

## 1.4 Assumptions - Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models will be utilized as part of the project predicting the IMDB rating, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): An algorithm that predicts values based on similarity to the nearest neighbors in the feature space. KNN can be applied to both classification and regression problems.
- Lasso Regression: Lasso Regression is a regularization technique that introduces penalties for large regression coefficients, leading to the selection of important features and elimination of irrelevant ones. Lasso Regression can be applied to regression problems.
- Ridge Regression: Ridge Regression is also a regularization technique, but it differs from Lasso Regression in the way penalties are introduced. Ridge Regression minimizes the sum of squares of regression coefficients, leading to their reduction. Ridge Regression is also applicable to regression problems.
- Decision Trees Regressor: Decision Trees are a method of creating a model in which decisions are made based on a series of questions about data features. Decision Trees can be used in both classification and regression problems.

## 1.5 Metrics Used for Predicting Continuous Values
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 
  - MSE = (1/n) * Σ(i=1 to n) (yi - ŷi)^2
  - This is one of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating regression models. MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted values (yi) and actual values (ŷi). The lower the MSE value, the better the predictive quality of the model.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
  - MAE = (1/n) * Σ(i=1 to n) |yi - ŷi|
  - MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted values (yi) and actual values (ŷi). MAE is less sensitive to outliers than MSE.
- Coefficient of Determination (R^2):
  - R^2 = 1 - Σ(i=1 to n)(yi - ŷi)^2 / Σ(i=1 to n)(yi - ȳ)^2
  - R^2 is a metric used to assess how well the model fits the data. R^2 value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit of the model to the data, and 0 indicates no fit. Negative R^2 values indicate that the model is worse than a simple horizontal line.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
  - RMSE = sqrt(MSE)
  - RMSE is the square root of MSE and measures the average difference between predicted values and actual values. It is particularly useful when we want a metric in the same unit as the predicted values. MSE and RMSE are both used to evaluate the performance of regression models, but RMSE is more commonly used when focusing on the magnitude of errors in the original data units.
  - Regression error metrics (MSE, MAE, R^2, RMSE) are used to evaluate the performance of regression models.
  - Where: 
    - n denotes the number of observations in the dataset, 
    - yi and ŷi are the actual and predicted values for the i-th observation, 
    - ȳ is the mean value of the actual target variable in the dataset.
